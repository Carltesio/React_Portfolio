                  Thanks for visiting my Portfolio webpage. <br></br>

                  My life journey is enriched by the mix of different cultures, from Italy to the US, South America to China and currently Sweden.
                  I started early my career as a Technician in a Design Studio developing Wearable Technologies, where I learned how to understand clients need and turn them into real products.
